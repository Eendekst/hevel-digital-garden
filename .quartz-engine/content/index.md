# The Treasure in the Field

> "It begins with the parable of the treasure in the field: a man who, upon finding something of ultimate value, joyfully re-orders his entire life to acquire it." — Matthew 13:44

Welcome to **Hevel**. This is a [[Digital Garden]] cultivated by [[Jason Guillauto]].
It is a convergence of **Faith**, **Intelligence**, and **Action**.

## The Signal
We believe effective action requires the mastery of two conflicting minds:
1.  **The Steward**: The Conviction. The "Why". The Anchor.
2.  **The Warrior**: The Pragmatism. The "How". The Engine.

Here, we do not choose between them. We wield both.
