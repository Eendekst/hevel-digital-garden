### Christ
*   "I adore Christ."
*   His works are seeds.
*   The Word of God is the seed that transforms into an accomplished promise for the one who seizes it.

### Divine Logic
*   **[[Cast Your Burden]]**: Throw it on Jehovah, and He will sustain you.
*   Despite the extent of our intelligence, it is God who works in us. God is Grace.
*   "Without Jehovah, I would not have even been able to create this vault."

### Priorities
*   Treat the most important things first (The Jar: Rocks before Sand).
