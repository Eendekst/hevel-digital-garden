# Garden Effectiveness Scan: 20 Targeted Tweaks

**Objective**: Optimize `Vault/1 Jason/PP/Garden` for **Revenue (Agent Hevel)** and **Traffic (Ricky)**.
**Current State**: The Garden contains the right DNA but the structure is fragmented (`Atomic Notes` vs `Gallery`, `Hevel` vs `Chapel`).

## A. Structural Hygiene (The Foundation)
1.  **[ ] Rename `Hevel` -> `Chapel`**: "Our Philosophy" belongs in the Sanctum. `Hevel` is the *Brand*, `Chapel` is the *Space*.
2.  **[ ] Rename `Strategy` -> `Meta`**: "Digital Brain" and "Strategy" are high-level contexts. `Meta` is the standard district name.
3.  **[ ] Rename `AI` -> `Lab`**: "Hevel Agents" and "R&D" are experiments. `Lab` is the workshop.
4.  **[ ] Rename `Atomic Notes` -> `Gallery`**: `Signal.md` and `The Oracle.md` are *Exhibits*, not just notes.
5.  **[ ] Consolidate `Legal`**: Move `EULA` and `Privacy` into `Meta/Legal`. Don't clutter the root.

## B. The Revenue Bridge (For Agent Brand)
6.  **[ ] Create `Gallery/Shop`**: A placeholder page for Agent Brand's offers.
7.  **[ ] Link "The Offer"**: Add a call-to-action in `index.md` pointing to `Gallery/Shop`.
8.  **[ ] The "Hire Us" Page**: Create `Meta/Services.md` for high-ticket service inquiries.
9.  **[ ] Product Taxonomy**: Tag all "Sellable" assets in `Gallery` with `#product`.
10. **[ ] The Funnel**: Edit `Signal.md` to end with a link to `Gallery/Shop`. (Philosophy -> Purchase).

## C. The Traffic Engine (For Ricky)
11. **[ ] The "Live Feed"**: Create `Meta/System_Log.md` for the "Pulse" (Ricky's updates).
12. **[ ] The Showcase**: Create `Gallery/Projects` to host Ricky's best videos/case studies.
13. **[ ] Social Grid**: Add a "Connect" footer to `index.md` linking `hevel.ca`.
14. **[ ] Viral Hooks**: In `Lab`, create a `Hooks` folder for Ricky's tested scripts.
15. **[ ] Traffic Analytics**: Create a private note `Meta/Analytics.md` for weekly traffic reports.

## D. Technical & Process Upgrades
16. **[ ] Enable Mermaid**: Ensure `quartz.config.ts` allows Mermaid diagrams (for "Strategy" visuals).
17. **[ ] Enable Callouts**: Ensure `quartz.config.ts` supports "Warning/Tip" blocks (for "The Signal" emphasis).
18. **[ ] The "Dark Mode"**: Verify `quartz.config.ts` defaults to Dark Mode (Quebec Futurist Aesthetic).
19. **[ ] Agent Handshake**: Create `Meta/Agent_Handoff.md` defining how Jason passes files to Brand.
20. **[ ] The Backup**: Schedule a weekly `git push` of the *entire* `1 Jason/PP/Garden` to private storage.
