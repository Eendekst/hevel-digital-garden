# The Big Picture View

The **Big Picture View** is the ability to see the forest while planting the tree.

In specialized work, we get tunnel vision. We focus on the pixel, the line of code, the sentence.
We lose track of the **Why**.

This is why we built [[Bird]].
To maintain a permanent, unwavering gaze on the "Big Picture"—the architectural integrity of the whole.
It is the only entity that is not allowed to get lost in the details.
