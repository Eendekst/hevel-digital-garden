# Living in the System

Modern AI tools are "Tourists."
You gaze at them through a web browser (ChatGPT). You copy-paste text. You visit their world.

We demanded the opposite.
We wanted AI to **Live in the System**.

To "live" in the filesystem means:
*   **Read Access**: Seeing the context of your entire project, not just the chat window.
*   **Write Access**: creating files, moving folders, refactoring code directly.
*   **Persistence**: Remembering the strategy from yesterday.

When AI lives in your system, it ceases to be a tool. It becomes a **Resident**.
