# The Digital Brain

Your **Digital Brain** is not a hard drive. It is an extension of your consciousness.

Most people treat their computer like a garage—a place to store junk.
We treat it like a **Temple**—a place to refine thought.

## The Principles
1.  **Interconnection**: Every file must link to another. An isolated file is a dead thought.
2.  **Fluidity**: Information must flow. Inputs -> Processing -> Outputs.
3.  **Resonance**: The system should surprise you. It should reveal connections you didn't know existed.

This Garden is the public face of my Digital Brain.
