## Description:
To leverage present day's opportunities I need a workflow and organization that's perfectly adaptive to content posting on various platform. 
The questions I must ask myself are the following.

What is the easiest way to export multiple files from obsidian (Canva, notes, files)

What app to use to craft content based on the import

How do I store my produced content

How do I store my published content

Before all this data validation is crucial ans will give us the blueprint for a storage strategy
