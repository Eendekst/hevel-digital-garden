**Your skills are the puzzle pieces of your potential.**

Isolated, a skill is just a tool—a hammer without a nail, a line of code without a program.
But when connected, they form a picture greater than the sum of its parts.

In the **[[Cybernetic Loop]]**, we do not just collect skills (Input); we fit them together (Process) to reveal the "Big Picture" (Output).

Don't hoard pieces. Build the puzzle.
