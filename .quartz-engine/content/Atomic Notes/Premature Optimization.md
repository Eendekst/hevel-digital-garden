# The Perversion of Efficiency

> *"Optimiser avant d'organiser perverti notre authenticité."*
> (Optimizing before organizing perverts our authenticity.)

We live in an era of "Hacks." We want to do things *faster* before we know *what* we are doing.
This strips the soul out of the process.

**Authenticity** requires friction. It requires doing it the hard way until you understand the "Why."
If you automate a chaotic process, you just get **Automated Chaos**.

**The Holy Order:**
1.  **Do** (Manual/Authentic)
2.  **Organize** (Structure/Logic)
3.  **Optimize** (Speed/Scale)
4.  **Automate** (Remove the Human)

Skip a step, and you lose the soul.
