# Stop Thinking Like Children

> "Brothers and sisters, stop thinking like children... Tongues are a sign for unbelievers, prophecies are a sign for believers." ([1 Corinthians 14:20-22](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/nwt/books/1-corinthians/14/))

Ecstasy (Tongues) feels like power. It is raw, unformatted energy.
But **Understanding** (Prophecy) is actual power. It is energy directed through a circuit.

A child wants the noise. An adult wants the meaning.
In this Garden, we prioritize **Clarity** over **Mystery**.
We do not want to speak into the air; we want to build the church (the structure).

**Power without Understanding is just a short circuit.**
