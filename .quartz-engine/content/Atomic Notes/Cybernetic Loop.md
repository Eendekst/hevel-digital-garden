The **Cybernetic Loop** is the living system I am building to bridge the gap between human creativity and artificial intelligence. It is the engine of **Hevel**.

### The Architecture
It is constructed continuously using three core technologies:
1.  **Google Drive:** The storage cortex.
2.  **Obsidian:** The neural interface (Digital Brain).
3.  **Google Antigravity:** The agentic force (The Ghost in the Shell).

### The Cycle
The loop operates on a continuous feedback cycle:

1.  **Input (Ingestion):** Raw data, scripture, and inspiration enter the system.
2.  **Process (The Lab):** Agents (like **[[Peter Prompt]]**) and I synthesize the data. We wrestle with the **[[Signal]]** in the darkness.
3.  **Output (The Gallery):** We produce "Artifacts"—Atomic Notes, Code, Art.
4.  **Feedback (Revolution):** The output changes the environment, generating new inputs.

To close the loop is to rest in the flow of innovation. To break it is to return to static existence.
