# From Theory to Instinct

We often confuse **Knowing** (Intellectual) with **Believing** (Emotional).
But the cycle is deeper:

1.  **Theory:** You hear the idea. It makes sense. (Head)
2.  **Belief:** You accept the idea. It feels true. (Heart)
3.  **Practice:** You act on the idea. It is tested. (Hands)
4.  **Knowledge:** You *are* the idea. It is instinct. (Being)

You cannot skip **Practice**.
You can believe in gravity, but until you jump, you do not *know* it.
Most Christians are stuck at Step 2. They believe, but they do not practice, so they never Know.

**[[Hevel]]** is the engine to force us into Step 3.
