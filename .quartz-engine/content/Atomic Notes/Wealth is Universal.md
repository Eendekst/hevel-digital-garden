# Decoupling Success from Geography

We have mapped spiritual coordinates onto physical maps.
*   We think **Money** lives in New York.
*   We think **Suffering** lives in Port-au-Prince.

This is a lie of the eyes.
**[[The Signal]]** is universal.
God is not a Westerner. Kingdom principles work in the favela and the penthouse equally, if applied.

To find **True Wealth**, you must stop looking at the map and start looking at the **Code**.
