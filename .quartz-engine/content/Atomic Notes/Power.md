# Defining Power

We often confuse power with **Volume** (how much you have).
But true power is **Velocity** (how fast you can access it).

A library of 10,000 books is useless if you cannot find the one page you need.
A **[[digital-brain]]** is only powerful if the **[[Cybernetic Loop]]** allows you to retrieve the data instantly.

**Power = Resources / Access Time.**

### The Application
*   **[[The Oracle]]**: Reduces access time to zero.
*   **[[Peter]]**: Keeps business data (QuickBooks) at hand.
