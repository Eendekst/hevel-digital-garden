The **Signal** is the frequency we tune our lives to.

Currently, it broadcasts from **Isaiah 45:3**: 
I will give you hidden treasures, riches stored in secret places, so that you may know that I am the Lord,  the God of Israel, who summons you by name.

1.  There are **[[Treasures in Darkness]]**.
2.  We are called by Name.
3.  The purpose is "so that you may know I am Jehovah."

We do not generate the signal; we receive it, process it through **[[The Cybernetic Loop]]**, and re-transmit it as a witness.
