In February 2025, I made the best decision of my life: taking the 5-day Google Gen AI intensive course on Coursera and synthesizing it to understand everything.

Since then, I decided to completely reimagine how I manage my digital environment, starting from my file explorer. This marked the beginning of life for this **Garden** and these **machines**.

Until today, I have strived to transform my computer's storage into a **[[digital-brain]]** with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). The reflection that pushed me to build my brand this way is based on:

> **Philippians 4:8** "Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is **true**, whatever is **noble**, whatever is **right**, whatever is **pure**, whatever is **lovely**, whatever is **admirable**—if anything is **excellent** or **praiseworthy**—think about such things."

For me, the answer to this command constitutes my core system:

### 1. Obsidian

*   Self-overview
*   Segmenting activities & roles

### 5. Portail Church
The church I attend, serve at, and where I was baptized.

### 6. [[The Cybernetic Loop]]
The system I am building with Google Drive, Obsidian, and Google Antigravity.
