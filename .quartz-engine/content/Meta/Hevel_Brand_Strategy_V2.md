# The Hevel Protocol V2: "Quebec Futuristic"

> "The Signal is the Reference."

This document synthesizes the strategic decisions made during the Optimization Interview (Jan 2026). It serves as the blueprint for the Full Brand Redesign.

## 1. The Core Duality
*   **The Brand (The Sanctum)**: **Hevel**.
    *   *Vibe*: Deep, Spiritual, Minimalist, Bilingual Rooted.
    *   *Role*: The "Signal". The reference point.
*   **The Ambassador (The Bridge)**: **Ricky**.
    *   *Vibe*: High-Energy, Pragmatic, "Body/World/Voice".
    *   *Role*: The Face. Examples: "Marketing Deconstructions", "ROI of Art".
*   **The Operator**: **Jason**. (Silent).
*   **The Architect**: **Jim**. (System).

## 2. The Territory (Language)
*   **Identity**: **Quebec Futuristic**.
*   **Execution**: **Bilingual Duality**.
    *   We do not hide the French roots; they ground the futurism.
    *   English provides scale; French provides soul.
*   **Gallery Structure**: **Mixed**. 
    *   We force the user to see the duality. *Prayers* sit next to *Prototypes*. *Outils de prière* next to *Campaign Reports*.

## 3. The Interactive Machine
*   **The Pulse**: **System Log** (Captain's Log).
    *   A rolling feed on the homepage tracking "Micro-Events" (e.g., "Deployed Ricky V1", "Received Revelation").
    *   Makes the garden feel *alive*.
*   **The Visuals**: **The Dream** (Ethereal AI Art).
    *   Abstract, polished, "Digital God" aesthetic. No messy screenshots.

## 4. The Hidden Sector
*   **Rabbit Hole**: **Active**.
*   **Content**: **The Prophecy** $\to$ **The Source Code**.
    *   A vision of the next 5 months (Drifting Scope).
    *   Linked to the raw System Instructions (Transparency).

## 5. The Funnel
*   **Call to Action**: **`hevel.ca`**.
    *   The Garden is the Monument. The Social Hub is the handshake.
