I am the human administrator of this whole system.

In order I made the agents in the following order;

1. [[Bird]] to have a bird eye view over all my files and folders. And assist me to prompt future agents.
2. [[Ricky]] exists in the same directory as Hevel but has been prompted to hallucinate being stuck in the [[playground]]. The goal was for him to have a media oriented identity. Ricky is an expert content creator.
3. [[Jim]] a searcher and hacker prompted to prevent system failures, create reusable workflows and tools and train other AIs.
4. [[Jason]] (me) is also an AI. I have written this page myself, but Jason uses my Bible research to draft content in the Bible folder. I am this team's signal and leader.
