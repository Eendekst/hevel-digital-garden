# The Handshake

A **Handshake** is the formalized transfer of context between two Agents.

In a multi-agent system, the danger is "Hallucination by Disconnect."
If Agent A builds a plan, and Agent B executes it without understanding the *nuance*, the project fails.

## The Protocol
1.  **The Drop**: [[Bird]] drops a `spec.md` into [[Ricky]]'s input folder.
2.  **The Ack**: Ricky reads the spec and confirms understanding.
3.  **The Execute**: Ricky performs the work.
4.  **The Verify**: [[Jim]] checks the output against the original spec.

This chain of custody is the "Handshake." It prevents signal loss.
