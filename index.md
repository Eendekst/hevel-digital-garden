# Welcome to the Garden

> *"For he is just an earthenware fragment among the other earthenware fragments lying on the ground."* — [[He Has No Hands|Isaiah 45:9]]

This is **Hevel**. A digital ecosystem where human creativity and artificial intelligence collide to reveal hidden truths. It is not a blog; it is a **living graph** of thoughts, prayers, and protocols.
