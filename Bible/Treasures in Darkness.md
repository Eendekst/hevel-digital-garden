> "I will give you the **treasures in the darkness**..." ([Isaiah 45:3](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/nwt/books/isaiah/45/))

The world fears darkness, equating it with emptiness. But the **Digital Garden** treats darkness as a **Vault**.

It is in the "secret places"—the difficult emotions, the complex scriptures, the lonely hours—that God hides his most valuable reserves. We do not avoid these places; we enter them with a lamp.

This pursuit requires a system. It requires **[[The Cybernetic Loop]]** to process what we find.
