> "Throw your burden on Jehovah, and he will sustain you. Never will he allow the righteous one to fall." ([Psalm 55:22](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/nwt/books/psalms/55/))

The command is seemingly violent: **Throw it.**

Do not hand it over politely. Do not share it tentatively. **Cast it.**
Anxiety, regret, shame—these are heavy weights. They are "fardeaux" (burdens) that crush the structure of our peace.

When we try to carry them, we wobble. When we throw them to the only One with shoulders broad enough to bear the universe, we find stability.
