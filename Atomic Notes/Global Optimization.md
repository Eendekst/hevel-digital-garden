# The State of Rate

**Global Optimization** is the holy grail of systems engineering.
It is not just making *one* part fast (Local Optimization); it is making the *whole* system coherent.

To achieve Global Optimization, you must:
1.  List every component.
2.  Map the connections.
3.  Conduct a proper **[[The APPASA Protocol]]** (Data Analysis).
