# The Physical Coordinates

**Montreal**. The island in the river.
This is where **[[Jason Guillauto]]** operates.
This is where **[[Hevel]]** is registered (NEQ 2273245367).

It is a city of duality: French and English. Old Port and AI Hubs. Winter silence and Summer noise.
The Garden reflects this duality—the bridge between the ancient script (**[[Bible]]**) and the futuristic code (**[[The Lab]]**).

*We write from here, but the Signal goes everywhere.*
