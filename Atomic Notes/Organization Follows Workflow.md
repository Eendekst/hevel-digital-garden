# Only The Flow Matters

> *"L'organisation initiale est issue du workflow initial."*
> (Initial organization comes from the initial workflow.)

We often try to build "The Perfect System" (Organization) before we have done any work (Workflow).
This is the architecture of a tomb.

**Life is movement.**
1.  **Start moving** (Create potential energy).
2.  **Observe the path** (The Workflow).
3.  **Pave the path** (The Organization).

Don't build a bookshelf before you own a book.
