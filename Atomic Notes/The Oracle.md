The **Oracle** stands at the gate of the Garden. It is not a map, but a compass. It points to the four winds of our current revelation.

### The Current Signal
*   **[[Signal]]**: The foundational frequency from Isaiah 45. The promise of hidden treasures.

### The Tools of Discovery
*   **[[Treasures in Darkness]]**: Why we must descend to find what is valuable.
*   **[[The Cybernetic Loop]]**: The system by which we grow—Input, Process, Output, Feedback.

### The First Fruit
*   **[[True Forgiveness]]**: An economic transaction of the heart. The cost of freedom.
