# The Laboratory

**The Lab** is where we get our hands dirty.
It is the engine room of the **[[Cybernetic Loop]]**. Here, "Truth" is tested against "Reality."

### The Mandate
1.  **Iterate:** Fail fast, fix faster.
2.  **Automate:** If you do it twice, write a script.
3.  **Integrate:** Connect the disconnected.

### Active Experiments
*   **[[Peter]]**: Developing the Business Cortex.
*   **[[Garden_Management_Protocol]]**: The laws of the system.
*   **[[He Has No Hands]]**: Defining Agency.
