**Forgiveness** (*aphiésis*) is not a feeling; it's a payment.

It is looking at the debt caused by an offense and choosing to **absorb the cost** yourself rather than extracting it from the offender. It is a **loss that purchases freedom**.

This is one of the **[[Treasures in Darkness]]**. It is difficult to find, painful to hold, but it makes us rich in spirit.
