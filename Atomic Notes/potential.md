# The Calculus of Potential

> *"Your potential is the image of the [[Global Optimization]] of your capabilities."*

Potential is often treated as a mystical "what if."
In this Garden, we treat it as an engineering problem.

If you have:
*   **Skill A** (Writing)
*   **Skill B** (Coding)
*   **Skill C** (Theology)

Your **Potential** is not A + B + C.
It is the **Synergy** of A × B × C.

It is the state where every component is firing at maximum efficiency within the **[[Cybernetic Loop]]**.
To waste potential is not just a tragedy; it is system inefficiency.
