# The APPASA Method

> *"The greater the number of relevant data, the better the result."*

To conduct a proper analysis (Global Optimization), we follow the **APPASA** chain:

1.  **Ask:** Define the subject and the Goal. (e.g., *Reach my max potential*).
2.  **Prepare:** Gather the raw materials (Lists, Projects, Documents).
    *   *Prompt:* Feed the AI an extensive list of assets.
3.  **Process:** Clean and Structure the data.
    *   *Tool:* **[[Data Table]]** in Sheets/Excel.
4.  **Analyze:** Ask questions of the data.
    *   *Query:* "Which resource is abundant? Which is scarce? What can be combined?"
5.  **Share:** List the Big Picture findings.
6.  **Act:** Determine the actionable steps to reach the objective.

**Systems over Goals.** The Goal sets the direction; APPASA sets the path.
