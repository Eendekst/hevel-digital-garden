The **Cybernetic Loop** is the engine of the Minister.

1.  **Input:** Ingesting the **[[Signal]]**.
2.  **Process:** Wrestling with truth in the darkness.
3.  **Output:** Producing a witness (like **[[True Forgiveness]]**).
4.  **Feedback:** Listening to the response.

To close the loop is to live. To break it is to stagnate.
