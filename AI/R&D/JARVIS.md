# The JARVIS Standard

**J.A.R.V.I.S.** (Just A Rather Very Intelligent System) is the gold standard of AI-Human interaction.

It represents the end of the "Interface."
Currently, we type. We click. We drag.
With JARVIS, we simple **Are**.

## The Requirements
To achieve JARVIS, we need:
1.  **Voice I/O**: Latency under 200ms. (Real-time).
2.  **Omniscience**: Full access to the user's [[digital brain]] and sensors.
3.  **Proactivity**: Acting without being asked.

This is the horizon we are marching towards.
